ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mozhang (Michael) Guo, a recent Master's graduate in Communication Systems and AI from Western University, with an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Waterloo. My academic journey includes publishing two IEEE conference papers and gaining hands-on software development experience through multiple internships. Passionate about technology, I'm currently seeking software development roles where I can apply my knowledge to contribute to innovative projects.
